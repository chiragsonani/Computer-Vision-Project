Issues:
-RANSAC always returning the largest plane might not be the correct floor in every situation.
-If noise produces a larger region, the actual box top might get ignored or not classified correctly.
-Fixed RANSAC parameters may not work in every situation.
-kernel size is fixed and not adaptive to object scale.
-We're considering each measurement separately. We can combine multiple views to average detections.
-No clue about whether the system is giving correct height/dimentions.
-Box orientation is not considered

Improvements:
-add model confidence criteria for early stopping.
-PCA to estimate box orientation 
-Fuse data of multiple views to improve accuracy.
